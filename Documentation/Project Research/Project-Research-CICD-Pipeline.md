# What is a CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery is a software development strategy in line with Dev-Ops that allows developers to automate the repetitive, time-consuming task of reliably deploying every new incremental update of code. The strategy enables a "flow" of changes from the developer making them all the way to the deployed instance.
  

# Setting up the Pipeline
The pipeline for this project will be fashioned around changes to the master branch on GitHub. A link will be set up between GitHub and Heroku by using the Integrations and Services available in the settings of the repository on GitHub.
  
We will first need to set up a GitHub auto-deployment service. This will also involve setting up GitHub tokens. By using the "Deploy on Status" option we can ensure that only builds that have been validated will be deployed on Heroku. Following this, we will need to set up a Heroku service, choose the branch to deploy and integrate it with Heroku tokens.
  
For the AWS Lambdas made with Go, tools like Apex and Amazon's CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy allow for seamless integration with GitHub repositories.

All work can be done by group members on their respective and branches and at the end of the week, the branches can be merged into the development branch and then to the master branch which will automatically deploy it to Heroku/AWS.

# Advantages of using the Pipeline
* Quick deployments to production will imply more time available to perform testing with other systems.
* Ability to deploy to production in seconds by just merging with master branch allows for code to be always up to date for other project team members to use or test.
* It enables increased reliability of releases with validation of builds in master branch and quick bug spotting with every release being easily monitored and tested.
* The production code can be made to perform different tasks by just changing the Procfile in the master branch.
* Integration and deployment can be conducted with ease.
