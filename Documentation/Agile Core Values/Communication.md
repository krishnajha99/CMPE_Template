# Communication

## Communication in Agile
Agile principles help the team members of a software project manage the development process in an efficient manner.
Agile teams are known to be highly efficient at getting work done. <br></br>Because **Agile teams share a collaborative culture**, efficiency tends to have a ripple effect. One of the core principles behind the infamous Agile Manifesto is **Communication**.


Innovation occurs only with the free interchange of conflicting ideas, which makes communication one of the very important Agile principles. Communication is all about shared understanding among the members of the Project team, when followed efficiently results in a high quality product.
<br></br>
The Agile Manifesto reads: 
<br/>_"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools."_<br/>
which effectively means that the Agile principles, as described in Agile Manifesto, place people before processes and tools, working software over documentation, **collaboration over negotiation** and change management over project planning.


Communication methodologies can range from every few minutes with pair programming, to every few hours with continuous integration, to every day with a daily stand-up meeting, to every iteration with a review and retrospective. The mode of communication has to be chosen in the best interest of the team.
<br>There are several forms of communication that can be adopted by the Agile teams based on the team's convenience. Some of them can be:
* The traditional **face-to-face meetings** conducted in each team. This method is described as the most efficient since the team members can openly communicate about the project status to all the team members, discuss impediments and solutions for the issues. 
* A **Task Board** with sticky notes in every step of the Project Life-cycle describing the backlogs and issues being faced. The task board is a great way to quickly show your project team the status of a project. 
* **Electronic communication** methods such as E-mails or using any other Internet messengers can be useful to teams having members in different locations and also help diffuse non-urgent information.
