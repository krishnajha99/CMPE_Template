# Courage

## Courage in Agile
From the principles in the Agile Manifesto, it is clear that Agile practices foster if not mandate an environment that empowers developers to always strive to achieve a higher quality product in a highly efficient fashion. In order to achieve this, however, it is imperative that the members of an Agile team demonstrate a great deal of courage.

To analyze the aforementioned statement, we refer to the following principles in the Agile Manifesto:
1. **Welcoming changes at late stages of development requires courage.** A developer must put aside any fears of additional effort or closing deadlines in order to adapt quickly to any changes in the requirements for customer's market advantage.
2. Working very closely with the business requires **courage to speak up and convey details** - good or bad - in a timely manner. This, additionally, involves, owning up to any mistakes and setting aside all apprehension while asking the right questions needed in order to alleviate misunderstandings and deliver the best product.
3. **By providing an environment of motivated, trusting, skilled and supportive individuals in a group, developers are enabled to be more courageous in endeavors** (like learning new technologies) that they would otherwise be apprehensive about undertaking.
4. **It takes courage to request for and speak up in a face-to-face conversation** which, in agile terms, is the most efficient and effective means of communication.
5. Being Agile involves continuous attention to excellence and reflection on the progress of a team to ensure a high-quality product. This is only made possible if team members **show courage in speaking out to take ownership for or call out potential errors** that could be detrimental to the product being developed as well as to **seek the help needed** in order to achieve the lofty standards of excellence that are required.
  
From the above, it is clear why Courage is a Core Value in an Agile Environment
