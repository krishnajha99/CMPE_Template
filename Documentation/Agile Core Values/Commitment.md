# Commitment  
## Commitment in Agile  
A simple definition of Commitment is about dedication that applies to the actions, the effort and not the final result. Commitment is and remains a core value of Agile methodology. The team members must be committed to success and be willing to create realistic goals and stick to them. Everyone should participate in the team to achieve an "all in situation" where everyone work together to meet their commitments and achieve team goals.

The Team commits to:
- Holding each other accountable to do whatever it takes to meet their commitments
- Creating and holding each other accountable to any team agreements they have made
- Believing that a whole team commitment means that the team succeeds or fails together
