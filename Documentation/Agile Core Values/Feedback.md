# Agile Core Value Feedback

Feedback loops serve as opportunities to increase productivity, either in an individualâ€™s performance or in project teamwork or process. Identifying areas for improvement throughout each sprint and turning them into action items can help you track and address the key challenges related to technology or product improvement.

Frequent feedback is vital for Agile development teams to understand whether the team is going in the direction as expected. 
if the feedback is obtained at the end of every iteration, it may be very easy for the team to make up the feedback and go along.It also serves as an important tool to adopt modifications in the application.
Highest business value features are delivered first to the customer by development teams through the use of early and frequent feedback.
